This is a sample web project developed using Java (JSP and Servlet) tech stack. In here, I used AJAX to send request from client to server. For this project I used Hibernate as relational mapping tool and also I used bootstrap 3 to make my jsps looks responsive and attractive. 
Note : This project developed using Netbeans IDE
